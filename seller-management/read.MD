this was in fact a service for the users as a whole. 
it started out as a service where seller and buyers 
both lived in one service, but as the application grew,
the application worked as two different things for the 
buyer and the seller. Hence, it only made sense to splice 
it up and separate the users.

I later want to make a user able to buy without having a user.
I want them to just give their number or a receipt number to be able to
Collect their order. This ofcourse comes with cons too, as if things 
go wrong, it might be harder to trace and fix etc.

i also thought of having his boat related, but as i continued working 
on that, it just made no sense. The boat itself made no sense to store, yet.
As when it was ashore for example, i could just use a calender service. 
I understood that I taught of the boat as the shop, which in reality/practise
is not true. I will later integrate the boat, but that for different purposes. 
The Norwegian fiskedirektoratet have an API to fetch and check boats, that i 
want to use to verify stores. Also, for when is the boat itself important?
Its not.
